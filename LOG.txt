4/2/2020 -	Briefly why RSA is vulnerable to a quantum computer:

"the security of RSA is based on the multiplication of two prime numbers (P and Q) to give the modulus value (N). If we can crack the N value, we will crack the decryption key."

(https://medium.com/coinmonks/integer-factorization-defining-the-limits-of-rsa-cracking-71fc0675bc0e)

Although the most recent success of RSA number factorisation was attributed to algorithm improvement (by a factor of 3-4) as oppose to computing power (1.25-1.67)
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_numbers#cite_note-37)
quantum computing power still poses a major potential threat to the difficulty of factorising semiprime numbers.
(https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9508027)

For other cryptographic algorithms the threat from a large scale quantum computer could be achieved via increasing the keysize (as is the case with symmetric key encryption systems) but as a public key based, key establishment algorithm RSA is vulnerable.




Briefly what is the PQC competition:

Its a project by NIST, formally PQC Standardisation, that is analysing a pool of signature schemes and encryption/key-establishment schemes for their viability as a standard for quantum computation-proofness, out of 69 originally submited, 17 encryption/key-establishment agorithms and 9 signature schemes have passed to the second round of testing

The idea of NTRU and how it differs from RSA:

NTRU can be modified to meet the computing power of the encoder/decoder and can have a shorter execution time at the cost of generating an undecipherable message.

NTRU's inputs are essentialy (N, p, q) and a set of Polynomials L of degree N with integer coefficients.

depending on the choice of polynomial sets, (described in the pdf) there are additional input(d) for binary NTRU or input (d,r) for symmetric NTRU.

N, p, q, and set L are public knowledge. The public and private keys are as follows:

priv 	f = [f1,f2,f3...fN] with f element of L

pub  	h = [h1,h2,h3...hN] with 0<= hi <q

the private key can be chosen almost randomly from the set L.

the message that is to be encrypted has to be broken into blocks of the form:

message - [m1,m2,m3...mN] with 0<= mi <p

message length <= Np (?)


to encode a message block, choose a random polynomial (encoding fuzz) 

U = [U1,U2,U3...UN] element of L

then compute:

e = U%h+m  (mod q)
 e:encrypted block
 h:public key
(% is multiplication of each numerical to form a new polynomial of lengh N)


to decode:
f:private key
s & t : numbers derived (explain later)
a specific polynomial  fp^-1 (see pdf) page 4, length N and each polynomial; 0<= polynom <p
 
 compute a;
 	a=f%e (mod q)

 create shifted polynomial b (see pdf page 4)


 recover message by computing

 b%fp^-1 (mod p)

 note that for the final step we change the modulus to base 'p' instead of 'q', this along with the private key f is what secures NTRU

check bits in each message block probably necesary,
normal cause of decoding failure is an incorrect value s, successive values of s-1, s+1, s+2, s-2 etc. will usually recover the message. Failing that, we say we have a 'gap failure' and thus the message cannot be decoded. "Allegedly" shouldnt be an issue if parameter values are "well chosen".

F%G requires N^2 multiplications and N^2 additions, thus encoding a message block takes O(N^2) for a block Nlog2q bits, and the same for decoding. 

This actually makes NTRU slightly faster than RSA for similar security levels.

So what are these polynomials?
