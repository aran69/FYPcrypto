4/2/2020 -	Briefly why RSA is vulnerable to a quantum computer:

"the security of RSA is based on the multiplication of two prime numbers (P and Q) to give the modulus value (N). If we can crack the N value, we will crack the decryption key."

(https://medium.com/coinmonks/integer-factorization-defining-the-limits-of-rsa-cracking-71fc0675bc0e)

Although the most recent success of RSA number factorisation was attributed to algorithm improvement (by a factor of 3-4) as oppose to computing power (1.25-1.67)
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_numbers#cite_note-37)
quantum computing power still poses a major potential threat to the difficulty of factorising semiprime numbers.
(https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9508027)

For other cryptographic algorithms the threat from a large scale quantum computer could be achieved via increasing the keysize (as is the case with symmetric key encryption systems) but as a public key based, key establishment algorithm RSA is vulnerable.




Briefly what is the PQC competition:

Its a project by NIST, formally PQC Standardisation, that is analysing a pool of signature schemes and encryption/key-establishment schemes for their viability as a standard for quantum computation-proofness, out of 69 originally submited, 17 encryption/key-establishment agorithms and 9 signature schemes have passed to the second round of testing 
(https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography/round-2-submissions)


The idea of NTRU and how it differs from RSA:

NTRU can be modified to meet the computing power of the encoder/decoder and can have a shorter execution time at the cost of generating an undecipherable message.

NTRU's inputs are essentialy (N, p, q) and a set of Polynomials L of degree N with integer coefficients.

depending on the choice of polynomial sets, (described in the pdf) there are additional input(d) for binary NTRU or input (d,r) for symmetric NTRU.

N, p, q, and set L are public knowledge. The public and private keys are as follows:

priv 	f = [f1,f2,f3...fN] with f element of L

pub  	h = [h1,h2,h3...hN] with 0<= hi <q 

set L is limited to:
binary;
d of the polynomial integers are 1
the rest are 0

in symmetric its more difficult...

the private key can be chosen almost randomly from the set L (this and the public key explained below).

the message that is to be encrypted has to be broken into blocks of the form:

message - [m1,m2,m3...mN] with 0<= mi <p



to encode a message block, choose a random polynomial (encoding fuzz) 

U = [U1,U2,U3...UN] element of L

then compute:

e = U%h+m  (mod q)
 e:encrypted block
 h:public key
(% is multiplication of each numerical to form a new polynomial of lengh N)


to decode:
f:private key
s & t : numbers derived (explain later)
a specific polynomial  fp^-1 (see pdf) page 4, length N and each polynomial; 0<= polynom <p
 
 compute a;
 	a=f%e (mod q)

 create shifted polynomial b (see pdf page 4)


 recover message by computing

 b%fp^-1 (mod p)

 note that for the final step we change the modulus to base 'p' instead of 'q', this along with the private key f is what secures NTRU

check bits in each message block probably necesary,
normal cause of decoding failure is an incorrect value s, successive values of s-1, s+1, s+2, s-2 etc. will usually recover the message. Failing that, we say we have a 'gap failure' and thus the message cannot be decoded. "Allegedly" shouldnt be an issue if parameter values are "well chosen".

F%G requires N^2 multiplications and N^2 additions, thus encoding a message block takes O(N^2) for a block Nlog2q bits, and the same for decoding. 

This actually makes NTRU slightly faster than RSA for similar security levels.

So what are these polynomials?
aswer well put here:
https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/7878/how-to-make-a-message-into-a-polynomial-on-ntru-encryption


creation of encoding and decoding keys:

select two random polynomials from the set L, polynomials f and g (all with N elements)
f will create the decoding key and should be kept secret. g will be used to create the public key and doesnt need to be kept any longer.

f has two inverse modulos to compute:

fq^-1=[w1, w2,... wN] with 0<=wi<q and f%fq^-1 = 1 (mod q)
this will be used to create the encoding key

fp^-1=[w1, w2, ...wN] with 0<=wi<p and f%fp^-1 = 1 (mod p)
this will be used in the decoding process

(note, gcd(f(1),pq) = 1   this is for security reasons)

compute the parity polynomial PI, where:
PI=[PI1, PI2, PI3..., PIN]

PI+F%G=0 (mod p) 0<=PIi<p

such that every coefficient of PI+F%G is divisible by p
Finally we can generaie the public encoding  key h:

h = [h1,h2,...hN]=PI%fq^-1 + g (mod q) 
note 0<= hk < q

we also need two shift values S and T
for binary 

s = [  q/2 + d(p-1) + (d^3)/N  ] mod q

t = q[  ( d(p-1) + (d^3)/N )/q  ] mod p

     ^this might be a typo will have to verify*****

for symmetric we have

s = [q/2 + p -1]   t=0


and thats basically everything you need to know -sic

summary of public variables :

L : the set the private key, formatted message blocks, polynomial for generating the public ket, and encoding fuzz is chosen from
N : the size of the vectors in L aswell as the size of the message block (must be prime) usually 251
d : the amount of '1's in every vector in set L (binary)
p : the base of the message polynomial block, is prime and coprime with q, usually 3
q : the base of the encrypted polynomial block, coprime with p (and bigger than p)(usually a multiple of 2?) 128
h : the public key (given by receiver)


Summary of semiprivate variables (sender):

m : message (broken into blocks of length N an of base p) 
U : random polynomial from L (encoding fuzz)
e : encoded message e = U%h+m  (mod q)

Summary of private variables (receiver):

f : the private key, a set of polynomials from L (the gcd(the sum of coefficients in f, pq)=1, aka coprime pq) (in binary d and pq must be coprime)
a : a set computed from f%e (mod q)
s : shift value given by [  q/2 + d(p-1) + (d^3)/N  ] mod q (derived from public knowledge)
t : shift value given by q[  ( d(p-1) + (d^3)/N )/q  ] mod p (derived from public knowledge)

b : a polynomial [b1, b2, ... bN] defined by : bk = ak + t - (0 if ak < s :: q if ak >= s)
fp^-1 : a polynomial of length N and base p computed in the key generation process
fq^-1 : a polynomial of length N and base q computed in the key generation process
			(these two are the inverse polynomial of f)
